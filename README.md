1. Plan the Application
Define functionalities: Add, view, update, delete, mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
Use Ruby's native JSON library for file persistence.
2. Set Up the Environment
Ensure Ruby is installed.
Familiarize yourself with Ruby's json module for reading and writing JSON files.
3. Design Classes
Task Class:
Attributes: title, due_date, is_complete.
Methods: Update title, update due date, toggle completion status.
ToDoList Class:
Attributes: A collection of tasks (Array of Task objects).
Methods:
Add a task.
Delete a task (by index or title).
Update task details.
List all tasks with statuses.
Save tasks to a JSON file.
Load tasks from a JSON file.
4. Set Up File Persistence
Create methods in the ToDoList class to:
Serialize tasks into JSON format and write them to a file.
Read JSON data from a file and deserialize it into Task objects.
5. Command-Line Interaction
Create a loop to handle user input.
Use gets.chomp for input.
Allow commands like add, view, update, delete, mark_complete, and exit.
Print clear prompts and feedback for each action.
6. Testing and Debugging
Test each feature individually.
Ensure tasks persist correctly between program runs.
7. Optional Enhancements
Add task prioritization.
Allow sorting tasks by due date or completion status.
Add colored output for better CLI readability (use gems like colorize).
